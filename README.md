## Simple Redesign

Recently, I learned the basics on how to use Sass. I decided to use the
new skill I’ve learned, in combination of my current knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and implement it into a simple redesign of my
friend Phil’s site. Philippe is an amazing artist who is currently showcasing his talent on his original site here:
